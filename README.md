Check out the getting started guide if this is the first time you've used Peppermint:

```
version: "3.1"

services:
  peppermint_postgres:
    container_name: peppermint_postgres
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: peppermint
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 1234
      POSTGRES_DB: peppermint

  peppermint:
    container_name: peppermint
    image: pepperlabs/peppermint:latest
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
      - 5003:5003
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - peppermint_postgres
    environment:
      DB_USERNAME: "peppermint"
      DB_PASSWORD: "1234"
      DB_HOST: "peppermint_postgres"

Once this is completed then you can go to your server-ip:3000 which was added to the compose file and login.

The default login credentials are

```
admin@admin.com
1234
```

## One click installers

## Motivation

- This was initially a project to tie together my react and nodeJS skills and show something for my portfolio
- It looked terrible! But it worked and showed functionaility, which got me a job.
- Learn and deploy with docker
- Redo the UI, completly from the ground up. Which has now been completed and for me looks great.
- Build on this foundation and create a fully fledged product which offers what the big boys offer, but, at a much better ROI than signing up for zendesk etc.

Give a ‚≠êÔ∏è if this project helped you!
